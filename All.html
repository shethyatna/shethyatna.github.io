Digambaras also believe that women cannot achieve liberation, and that they must be reborn as men in order to do so.Also the digambaras don't touch the god idols in the temple they belief in only worshiping the idol from far that is the reason there are different temples for the diganbaras. 
Svetambaras (meaning "white-clad") are the more liberal sect of Jainism. Svetambara monks and nuns wear white clothes, and Svetambaras believe that women can achieve liberation just like men.The Svetanbaras do puja ( touch the god idol and worship) they bath every time before touch the  idol also there should be seprate clothes for the worship.The Svetanbaras use , saffron juice , milk , water and gold and silver  to worship the idol. ALso they perform making swastika from rice grains . These items are than given to needy . The idea here is to worship the god with the best in the world things. </p>

<h2 style="color:#fcc100;font-family:sans-serif; text-align:center; vertical-align:top;font-size: 35px;"> HISTORY OF  JAINISM   </h2>

<p style="margin-left:8%;font-family:sans-serif;margin-right:8%;color:white;font-weight:500;font-size:30px;">Jainism is an ancient religion that originated in India. It is one of the oldest religions in the world, and it is estimated to have been around for over 2,500 years.The history of Jainism is divided into two periods: the ancient period and the medieval period. The ancient period began with the life of Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara of Jainism. Mahavira is believed to have lived in the 6th century BCE, and he is credited with teaching the Jain path of non-violence, ahimsa, and compassion.The medieval period began with the death of Mahavira and continued until the 12th century CE. During this period, Jainism spread to other parts of India and to other countries, such as Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Jainism also flourished during this period, and many important Jain texts were written during this time.In the 12th century CE, Jainism began to decline in India. This was due to a number of factors, including the rise of Islam and the decline of the Jain merchant class. However, Jainism continued to be practiced in India, and it is still a thriving religion today. </p>

<h2 style="color:#fcc100;font-family:sans-serif; text-align:center; vertical-align:top;font-size: 35px;"> PHILOSOPHY IN JAINISM   </h2>

<p style="margin-left:8%;font-family:sans-serif;margin-right:8%;color:white;font-weight:500;font-size:30px;">principles of non-violence, ahimsa, and compassion. Jains believe that all living things have souls, and they strive to avoid harming any living thing.One of the central concepts in Jain philosophy is the concept of karma. Karma is a law of cause and effect that states that every action has a reaction. Jains believe that the actions we take in this life determine our fate in the next life. The goal of Jainism is to achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death, which can be achieved by following the Jain path of non-violence, ahimsa, and compassion.Another important concept in Jain philosophy is the concept of anekantavada, which means "many-sidedness." Jains believe that reality is complex and multifaceted, and that there is no single truth. They also believe that all beings are interconnected, and that we are all responsible for each other.Jain philosophy has a number of implications for our everyday lives. For example, Jains believe that we should avoid harming any living thing, even insects and plants. They also believe that we should be honest and truthful in our dealings with others. Jains also believe that we should be compassionate and understanding towards others, even those who have wronged us.
